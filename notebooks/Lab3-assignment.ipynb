    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the assignment for Lab 1 of the text mining course. We assume you have worked through the notebooks \"Lab1-introduction-to-NLTK\" and \"Lab1-introduction-to-Spacy\". In these notebooks, we use the example text \"apple-samsung-example.txt\". For the assignment you need to create a notebook yourself using an example text of your own:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create a file with an English text of around 500 words. Make sure the text is in UTF-8 encoding.\n",
    "* Use NLTK to:\n",
    "    * Tokenize the text and count the words\n",
    "    * Extract the sentences from the text\n",
    "    * Select one tokenized sentence from the text include Named Entities and apply part-of-speech tagging (take a long sentence that also shows various interesting properties)\n",
    "    * Augment the RegexpParser so that it also detects Named Entity Phrases (NEP) \n",
    "    * Apply the augmented RegexpParser to the selected sentence\n",
    "    * Visualise the tree structure and include the image in your report\n",
    "    * Use the Entity Chunker of NLTK to extract entity types from the last sentence \n",
    "* Use Spacy to process the same text as you just processed with NLTK\n",
    "    * Select the same sentence as selected above and compare the tokens and part-of-speech tags of Spacy with the NLTK output. Report any differences. Any idea why?\n",
    "    * Compare the chunks of Spacy with the noun constituents you created for NLTK. Report any differences. Any idea why?\n",
    "    * Visualise the dependecy structure of the sentence through Spacy. Save the image and compare it with the structure created through your parser with NLTK. Compare and discuss differences if any.\n"
