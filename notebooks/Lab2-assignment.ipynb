    "This notebook describes the assignment for Lab 2 of the text mining course. We assume you have worked through the notebooks \"Lab2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb\", \"Lab2-Sentiment-analysis.with-NLTK.ipynb\" and \"Lab2-Sentiment-analysis.with-Skikitlearn.ipynb\". In these notebooks, you have worked with the VADER tool, trained a classifier in NLTK and with Skikit learn\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learned how to create a gold standard and carry out an evaluation with Skikit-learn.\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own goldstandards set from 50 tweets. You need to apply the VADER, NLTK and SKIKIT classifier to these tweets and evaluate the results using the SKIKIT learn evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* collect 50 tweets for evaluation\n",
    "* create a gold evaluation set\n",
    "* create predicted output using VADER, NLTK-movie-review, Skikit-learn-movie-review\n",
    "* use Skikit learn evaluation metrics to get the evaluations: accuracy, recall, precision, f1\n",
    "\n",
    "Next train a classifier (NLTK or Skikit-learn) from another data set. Here are some data sets for sentiment analysis:\n",

    "* https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki/Sentiment-Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Take one of these data sets and train a NaiveBayesClassifier. You need to find a way to obtain the correct training data. You may need to define a loop to read the texts from each file and get the word features from each. Make sure you concatenate the features and do not loose them along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide statistics on the data set: how many files per category, how many features. \n",
    "* Divide a split over training and test data. \n",

    "* Apply this new classifier to the same gold data as above and report again on the evaluation results\n",
