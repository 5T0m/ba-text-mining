# Course Text Mining
This repository contains the material used in the Text Mining course as taught at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

There are two folders:
* **lab_sessions**: these contain one folder for each lab session as well as a folder called *other* with material that could be useful for future editions of the course.
